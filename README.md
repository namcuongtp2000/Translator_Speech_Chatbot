# Translator_Speech_Chatbot
I hope this simple DIY chatbot make you feel like using Google Assistant, Cortana or Whisper of ChatGPT. If you want to use it in your projects, please reference THIS GITHUB LINK.

Open GUI to start using: python chatgui_speech.py

Functions: 
1. Chatbot can response some questions and patterns from scenario in "intents.json".
2. Use ðŸŽ¤ microphone or text to insert massages for chatbot input.
3. Chatbot can answer by the same language which we use as input.
4. Chatbot can summarize long text via upload text file or insert text in text entry box and speak results by English.
5. Search results in the internet and return web links via text in text entry box.

Plans:
1. Improve and train a more extensive scenario for chatbot which can cover as much as possible intents of users and answer satisfied results.
2. This chatbot can not compare to ChatGPT and if we use ChatGPT instead, that will be awesome. (However, ChatGPT is now not supported in my country so I make my own.)
3. Instead of using google speaker, we can use any natural voice free or paid in the internet to improve our using experience by using url key.
4. Combine 2 & 3, we can certainly create a modern chatbot which can automatically response for example it can talk with other players in games through game chat microphone.
5. Add more functions for example Search or Provide images, use another AI to detect and assign object's labels in images or image captions as input for chatbot and even more.
6. Design modern interactive interface and utilities for Chatbot in Android Platform or Windform applications.
